TODO:
* store and access recipes with their unique IDs (uuid implementation)
* in case of a non-firebase backend: delegate shopping list ingredients to separate table in DB (with one-to-many relationship with recipes) identified by ID, not by name
* implement proper thumbnails
* change recipe list on mobiles to slide from the side instead of being on top
